# Topic-Modeling-of-BBC-News
In this project, we will apply topic modeling to a collection of news articles from the BBC datasets. BBC corpus consists of thousands of articles including politics, business, sports, entertainment, and technology topics. By analyzing this corpus using topic modeling, we will gain insights into the article's most important issues and trends. We will apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, used in the field of natural language processing. We will experiment with different words for a number of topics to obtain the best possible results.
